# PyAdv
* Is PyAdv better that python?
**For me, yes**. Because my friends say that just a professional python created code takes too much bytes for your system, so I decided to make python shorter by this module.
* Is it easy to create an easier version of python?
Actually, **no**. Because turning an easy language to much easier is very hard, because to execute a hard command properly in an already easy language you need to know this language almost fully. So, the best thing that I will everytime use is create files using pyadv, like agree, it is 100% easy.
* Is pyadv free to use?
Of course! Maybe there's too many people that hates python and really wants something easier, so I made this python module **for free and easier!**
